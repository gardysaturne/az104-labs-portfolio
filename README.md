## Purpose

This repository documents my hands-on preparation for the Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification.

The focus is practical Azure administration aligned directly to the AZ-104 exam domains. Each lab is built from the official Microsoft learning paths and implemented in a live Azure subscription to reinforce real operational experience — not just theoretical review.

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate:

- Structured execution of AZ-104 domain objectives
- Administrative decision-making within subscription and resource group scope
- Secure identity and RBAC implementation
- Virtual networking and storage configuration with cost and performance awareness
- Deployment using Azure Portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, ARM templates, and Bicep
- Validation, monitoring, and day-two operational considerations

The goal is to validate Azure administrator competency through repeatable, controlled deployments that reflect real-world cloud management responsibilities.

## AZ-104 Objective Alignment

Each lab maps directly to the official AZ-104 exam skills outline:

### 1. Manage Azure Identities and Governance
- Microsoft Entra ID configuration
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Subscriptions and resource group structure
- Policy and governance fundamentals

### 2. Implement and Manage Storage
- Storage accounts (Blob, Files)
- Access tiers and redundancy options
- Secure access using keys, SAS, and RBAC
- Storage network restrictions

### 3. Deploy and Manage Azure Compute Resources
- Virtual Machines
- Availability sets and zones
- Scaling considerations
- VM networking and disk configuration

### 4. Configure and Manage Virtual Networking
- Virtual networks and subnets
- Network Security Groups
- Load Balancer fundamentals
- DNS and connectivity configuration

### 5. Monitor and Back Up Azure Resources
- Azure Monitor
- Log Analytics basics
- Alerts and diagnostic settings
- Backup and recovery fundamentals

## Approach

All labs are performed in an active Azure subscription to simulate real administrative workflows.

Where applicable, deployments are validated using:
- Portal inspection
- CLI / PowerShell verification
- Resource validation commands
- Configuration review against intended state

The emphasis is disciplined execution, repeatability, and operational clarity — not just feature familiarity.
