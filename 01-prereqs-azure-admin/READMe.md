## Purpose
This repository documents hands-on Azure AZ-104 labs designed to demonstrate **real-world administrative decision-making**, not just command execution.

Each exercise shows:
- When to use the Azure Portal vs Cloud Shell vs scripting
- How to validate deployments and audit changes
- How cost, access, and visibility factor into day-to-day cloud operations


## Labs Overview
- **EX1 – Azure Portal:** Manual deployment, visibility, and ops dashboards
- **EX2 – Azure Cloud Shell:** Admin-from-anywhere and incident-response workflows
- **EX3 – PowerShell:** Object-based resource management and automation
- **EX4 – Bash + Azure CLI:** Cross-platform scripting and fleet inspection
- **EX5 – ARM Template Infrastructure As Code** Cross-platform scripting and fleet inspection
